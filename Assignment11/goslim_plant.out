GO:0030246	carbohydrate binding	molecular_function	"Interacting selectively and non-covalently with any carbohydrate, which includes monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides as well as substances derived from monosaccharides by reduction of the carbonyl group (alditols), by oxidation of one or more hydroxy groups to afford the corresponding aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, or by replacement of one or more hydroxy group(s) by a hydrogen atom. Cyclitols are generally not regarded as carbohydrates." [CHEBI:16646, GOC:mah]
GO:0030312	external encapsulating structure	cellular_component	"A structure that lies outside the plasma membrane and surrounds the entire cell. This does not include the periplasmic space." [GOC:go_curators]
GO:0030528	obsolete transcription regulator activity	molecular_function	"OBSOLETE. Plays a role in regulating transcription; may bind a promoter or enhancer DNA sequence or interact with a DNA-binding transcription factor." [GOC:mah]
GO:0038023	signaling receptor activity	molecular_function	"Receiving a signal and transmitting it in the cell to initiate a change in cell activity. A signal is a physical entity or change in state that is used to transfer information in order to trigger a response." [GOC:bf, GOC:signaling]
